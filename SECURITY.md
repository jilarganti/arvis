# Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please open a private vulnerability report at [Security](https://github.com/jilarganti/arvis/security).

While the discovery of new vulnerabilities is rare, we also recommend always using the latest versions of Arvis to ensure your application remains as secure as possible.
