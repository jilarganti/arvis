# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

To ensure a welcoming and positive environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, commit to making participation in our project and community free from harassment for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. It's important to note that adherence to one's religion, political party, or other ideological beliefs does not exempt one from adhering to this Code of Conduct.

## Expected Behavior

Behaviors that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Employing welcoming and inclusive language
- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting constructive criticism graciously
- Prioritizing what is best for the community
- Demonstrating empathy towards other community members

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- Sexualized language or imagery, unwanted sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Harassment in public or private
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Any conduct deemed inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities of Project Maintainers

Project maintainers are tasked with clarifying acceptable behaviors and are expected to take appropriate and equitable action in response to instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the authority to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, and other contributions that don't align with this Code of Conduct, or to ban contributors temporarily or permanently for behaviors they find inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, as well as in public spaces when an individual is actively representing the project or its community. This includes using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed delegate at events.

## Enforcement

Reports of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be made by contacting the project team directly at [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/jilarganti/arvis/discussions). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is committed to maintaining confidentiality for the reporter of an incident. Specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may face temporary or permanent repercussions as defined by the project leadership.
