#### List session users QoS

This section describes the request related to returning a list of session users from live or past sessions along with
the quality of service (QoS) they received during the session. The data returned indicates the connection quality for
sending and receiving video, audio, and shared content. You can specify a monthly date range for the dashboard data
using the from and to query parameters. The month should fall within the last six months. If you do not provide the type
query parameter, the API defaults to the live value and will only return metrics for users in a live session, if a
session is currently in progress. To view metrics on past session users, provide the past value for the type query
parameter.

<details>
Our API is similar to the Zoom API and uses similar methods and data models. Detailed information about the Zoom API

# 9 Architecture Decision Log

Since the spring of 2024, Sergei Fomin and Alexey Korolev have been discussing the basic requirements and approaches for
the implementation of the new Mind back-end service. As a result, the most important points are as follows:

- It has to be implemented based on Mind API/SDK (facading its API and types);

- It has to be AI Summarizer service facade;

- It has to be Zoom-like in terms of API, so that existing customers would be able to easily use our API instead of
  Zoom;

- It has to support FCM/APNS so that later our iOS application would be able to support PIP mode;

During the discussion Sergei and Alexey created a
[document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_xXEVklcXD8mxex1ybweNNEkTI7_0Ee-CNg79VBF2_I/edit?usp=sharing). It could
help to analyze architectural decisions taken in the first steps of service design.
