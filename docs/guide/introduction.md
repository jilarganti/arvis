## How It Works!

Similar to a video conference like Google Meet, Zoom, or MS Teams, but with the presence of an AI assistant named A.R.V.I.S. during group meetings. It retains the entire context of the group's communications throughout the entire duration of the group's interactions, including all conversations during meetings, chat interactions, presentations, and attached documents. 

Every registered user and each group meeting possess their unique assistant:
- **User Assistant**: Specifically trained on the context of a user's group meetings. It is exclusively accessible to that user.
- **Group Assistant**: Trained on the context of the group's meeting participants. It is available to all members of the group.

The types of data accessible for assistant training can be restricted up to complete inaccessibility of any information. Upon the deletion of a user or group, the corresponding assistant is eliminated and is irrecoverable. If a user re-registers, the assistant will start its training from the beginning.

- **Leverages historical data**: The AI analyzes information from past sources. This allows it to understand the context, consider previous decisions and discussions, making its advice and recommendations more accurate and relevant.
- **Focused on tangible results**: The ultimate goal of the assistant is not just to participate in the process but to ensure real, measurable outcomes. It aims to make every action and suggestion contribute to achieving specific goals, making your work more effective.
- **Represents you with strategic insight**: The assistant can act on your behalf in meetings, possessing a strategic vision. This means it can participate in discussions, offer ideas, and solutions that align with your long-term goals and objectives.

A.R.V.I.S. can assist you in various ways:
- **Discovering Goals, Summaries, and Outcomes of Past Meetings**: A.R.V.I.S. enables you to comprehend the objectives, summaries, and results of previous gatherings.
- **Setting Goals for Future Meetings**: It aids in establishing new objectives, crafting agendas, and predicting the accomplishment of these objectives.
- **Monitoring the Discussion**: Guided by the agenda, established goals, and timing of the meeting, A.R.V.I.S. ensures that the conversation remains on track.
- **Serving as a Consultant**: Throughout the meeting, A.R.V.I.S. acts as a consultant to you and other participants, providing insights and information.
