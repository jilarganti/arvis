# Get started with A.R.V.I.S.

A.R.V.I.S. is a self-learning LLM agent tailored to the specifics of your video conferences â€“ this includes records of meetings, chat discussions, screen presentations, and attached documents. **A.R.V.I.S. attends every non-confidential meeting and memorizes only what you permit it to.** Its abilities depend on the level of knowledge it is allowed to acquire and grow with each subsequent meeting. Once it achieves your level of intelligence, it will be capable of substituting you and conducting meetings in your stead.
